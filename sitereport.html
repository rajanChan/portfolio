                <h2>Development Journey</h2>
                <p>Building this portfolio has been a rewarding experience, allowing me to deepen my skills in web development. The process started with mapping out the site's structure and flow to ensure intuitive navigation.</p>
                <p>One of the key challenges was crafting a responsive design that maintains consistency across various screen sizes. Utilizing CSS Flexbox and Grid, along with media queries, ensured adaptability on mobile and desktop devices.</p>
                <p>Debugging and refining the layout involved frequent use of browser developer tools, emphasizing the importance of clean, semantic code to avoid cross-browser issues.</p>

            <section class="report-section">
                <h2>Reflective Insights</h2>
                <p>This project has strengthened my grasp of essential web technologies like HTML5 and CSS3. The hands-on experience underscored how crucial user experience and accessibility considerations are in web design.</p>
                <p>I learned to approach design from the perspective of end-users, focusing on clarity, ease of use, and visual appeal. This mindset guided my decisions on typography, color schemes, and layout structure.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, this portfolio is not just a collection of pages but an engaging interface that represents my professional identity.</p>
            </section>

            <section class="report-section">
                <h2>Design Choices</h2>
                <p>The color palette was selected to evoke a calm yet professional tone, with #00b4d8 as the primary accent color to highlight important elements. This blue shade conveys trustworthiness and modernity.</p>
                <p>For typography, I chose 'Segoe UI' for its clean, readable appearance, complemented by clear headings to establish a visual hierarchy that guides visitors smoothly through the content.</p>
                <p>My layout follows minimalist principles, focusing on whitespace and simplicity to ensure content is front and center. Influences include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dribbble – for inspiration on modern UI elements</li>
                    <li>Behance – portfolio layouts and structure</li>
                    <li>Google Material Design – color and typography guidelines</li>
